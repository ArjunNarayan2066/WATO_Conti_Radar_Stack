## WATonomous ARS430 Radar Code
This repository contains WATonomous's ROS Driver code for the ARS430 Automotive Radar.
The code is copied from our private internal GitLab repository, and so does not contain the full history.
This repository was used to share our code with Continental for assistance and advice.

This driver is inside the ars430_ros_publisher directory and builds a ROS package named ars430_ros_publisher.
Place this repository inside a catkin workspace src/ folder to build.
Check the detailed README.md inside that folder for instructions on running it.

Several ROSBags and associated .mp4 recordings are included in the rosbags folder.
These can be played with the nodes inside the ROS package to replay the data in RVIZ.
